# ZyganSSVMAddons

This is an addon pack for SSVM, it needs it to function

to add the addon simply download this repo as a zip and extract in your starbound mods folder, or clone it there

## Features

### Playable VSOs

These can be purchased from the vendor in foodhall under the VSO tab, upon use you will be given a head tech that allows you to play as the VSO!

Remember to bind tech action 2 and 3 in the options if they are not bound, we recommend keys G and H for the actions respectively
H/tech action 3 can then be used to access an options menu for the VSO when active

Directional keys typically either move the VSO around as any player would, or shift it up and down between states, primary click to attack and eat players/NPCs usually
and G/tech action 2 to release prey, which can also be done from the settings menu
