# ZyganSSVMAddons

To install simply visit the [releases page](https://github.com/Zygahedron/ZyganSSVMAddons/releases), download the latest one (the .pak file), and put it in your Starbound mods folder.

This mod Requires [Stardust Core](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=764887546)

Alternatively, if you want the latest and greatest changes, download this repo as a zip and extract in your starbound mods folder, or better yet, use git to clone it there so that you can update it more easily. Just be warned that things won't always be perfectly stable.

While not required it is recommended you install the Monster Config Core Loader mods found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2442860690) and [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2442873217), and if you're using FU you'll also need [this](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2442880727) because it should fix potential compatibility issues.

## Features

### Global Settings

#### Pred Tab

The Settings menu will open to the Global Pred settings tab by default, these settings effect how you will perform as a predator.

The belly effect names are self explanitory, the rate at which they work is effected by your attack power.

Escape modifier controls the difficulty of your prey being able to escape if you're in a state they can escape from

Display DoT effects causes the prey to emit numbers based on damage being taken.

Belly Sounds controls whether your belly will be silent or emit gurgles.

#### Prey Tab

Some people don't like certain kinds of vore, some people don't like vore at all! but they still might want to play games with other people who do, and this is meant to make that much easier.

Players can use the quickbar to access Starbecue's settings, the prey tab brings up a window with a bunch of checkboxes, this allows you to opt in and out of what types of vore can be done to you, check it if you're ok being prey for it, uncheck if you aren't, if you don't want to be prey at all just uncheck the "Prey Enabled" at the bottom of the menu, which overrides all the others.

Currently this does not affect whether any other vore mods can or can't perform vore on the player.

### Predators

Special potions can be purchased from Auri's shop which can transform you into large predators, and grants you a head tech that allows you to choose which one you wish to transform into if you've unlocked multiple.

Full use of this system requires you to bind Tech Action 2 and 3 in the options if they aren't already bound. We recommend the G and H keyes respectively, because they're right by F, and that's what they were back in really old versions of the game when they were actually used in vanilla.

When turning into a predator you will be given a controller item, this is required for the predator transformation to detect some keys being pressed, such as Shift, as well as pass some more data to the vehicle that it cannot detect without it.

Holding Tech Action 1 (F) while controlling a pred allows you to bring up its action wheel, the X at the bottom will despawn the pred, choosing another action will attempt to perform that action, some of these will need to be aimed, so you might want to assign that action to a controller by clicking on it, if you have a controller in the hand of the click, it will assign it that action, if the hand was empty, it will spawn a new controller for you. Keep in mind a pred might have some actions that are available in some states but not others, clicking with a controller with an assigned action that the pred does not have will not result in anything.

Most predators will have the same movement controls a player would, but tapping movment keys can be used to transition between different poses, like standing or sitting or sleeping, etc.

To let people out that you previously ate, simply press Tech Action 2 (G).
