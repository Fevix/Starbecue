# ZyganSSVMAddons

To install simply visit the [releases page](https://github.com/Zygahedron/ZyganSSVMAddons/releases), download the latest one (the .pak file), and put it in your Starbound mods folder.

Alternatively, if you want the latest and greatest changes, download this repo as a zip and extract in your starbound mods folder, or better yet, use git to clone it there so that you can update it more easily. Just be warned that things won't always be perfectly stable.

While not required it is recommended you install the Monster Config Core Loader mods found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2442860690) and [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2442873217), and if you're using FU you'll also need [this](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2442880727) because it should fix potential compatibility issues.

## Features

### Prey Enabler

Some people don't like certain kinds of vore, some people don't like vore at all! but they still might want to play games with other people who do, and this is meant to make that much easier.

Players can craft an item called the "Prey Enabler" with their empty hands for one pixel, this item brings up a window with a bunch of checkboxes, this allows you to opt in and out of what types of vore can be done to you, check it if you're ok being prey for it, uncheck if you aren't, if you don't want to be prey at all just uncheck the "Prey Enabled" at the bottom of the menu, which overrides all the others.

Currently this does not affect whether any other vore mods can or can't perform vore on the player.

### Playable VSOs

Special items can be purchased from the vendor at the food hall under the VSO tab, which instead of summoning a vso in the world to eat you, give you access to a head tech that allows you to transform yourself into, and thus play as, that VSO!

Full use of this system requires you to bind Tech Action 2 and 3 in the options if they aren't already bound. We recommend the G and H keyes respectively, because they're right by F, and that's what they were back in really old versions of the game when they were actually used in vanilla.

When turning into a VSO you will be given a controller item, this is required for the VSO to detect some keys being pressed, such as Shift, as well as pass some more data to the vehicle that it cannot detect without it.

Holding Tech Action 1 (F) while in a VSO allows you to bring up its action wheel, the X at the bottom will despawn the VSO, choosing another action will attempt to perform that action, some of these will need to be aimed, so you might want to assign that action to a controller by clicking on it, if you have a controller in the hand of the click, it will assign it that action, if the hand was empty, it will spawn a new controller for you. Keep in mind a VSO might have some actions that are available in some states but not others, clicking with a controller with an assigned action that the VSO does not have will not result in anything.

Most VSOs will have the same movement controls a player would, but tapping movment keys can be used to transition between different poses, like standing or sitting or sleeping, etc.

To let people out that you previously ate, simply press Tech Action 2 (G). Alternatively, you can let them out via the settings menu, accessible from the action wheel (F). When This menu also has settings to heal/digest your prey, how easy it is to escape, if DoT numbers should display, and whether you want your belly to be noisy, said options are global and apply to every VSO, so you won't have to set those settings for each one, further settings will only apply to that specific VSO such as if it will automatically deploy when you warp to another world (will only trigger if it was the most recent one selected) and some VSOs may have settings specific to it, some may also have customization options, which will be accessed from clicking the color palette button in the top right of the menu, and you can return to the settings from the gear in the same place in that menu.
