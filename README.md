# ZyganSSVMAddons

To install simply visit the [releases page](https://github.com/Zygahedron/ZyganSSVMAddons/releases), download the latest one (the .pak file), and put it in your Starbound mods folder.

Alternatively, if you want the latest and greatest changes, download this repo as a zip and extract in your starbound mods folder, or better yet, use git to clone it there so that you can update it more easily. Just be warned that things won't always be perfectly stable.

While not required it is recommended you install the Monster Config Core Loader mods found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2442860690) and [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2442873217) because it should fix potential compatibility issues with other mods.

## Features

### Vaporeon

![](/vehicles/spov/vaporeon/vaporeon.png)

This extra large fishcat can eat up to 2 people at once, and comes with extra features such as:
- Letting you lay on top of its belly, instead of inside;
- Rolling over and laying on top of you in return;
- Using its fluid nature to suck you directly into its stomach!

Additionally, you can feed it the standard easy/anti-escape and heal/digest pills, along with a new fattening donut to make its belly a bit bigger without needing anyone inside. The donut and a diet pill to reverse its effect are purchasable in the same places as the other pills, of course.

Last but not least, even more functionality can be unlocked through the Playable VSO system (detailed more below), including walking around, shrinking smaller to fit through tight gaps, spraying water at your enemies, and more!

### Xeronious

This commissioned kaiju is able to fit a total of three prey in his belly! he can also eat one with his tail
- Sitting down and hugging you
- Letting you struggle and between the belly and tail
- Soft digest putting you in an egg they can lay

### Playable VSOs

Special items can be purchased from the vendor at the food hall under the VSO tab, which instead of summoning a vso in the world to eat you, give you access to a head tech that allows you to transform yourself into, and thus play as, that VSO!

Full use of this system requires you to bind Tech Action 2 and 3 in the options if they aren't already bound. We recommend the G and H keyes respectively, because they're right by F, and that's what they were back in really old versions of the game when they were actually used in vanilla.

To eat people, npcs, or monsters, simply walk up to them and left-click on them to swipe at and grab them. This same action will also do some damage to enemies.
The same movement keys are also used to transition between different poses, like standing or sitting or sleeping, etc.
To let people out that you previously ate, simply press Tech Action 2 (G). Alternatively, you can let them out via the menu, accessible by pressing Tech Action 3 (H). This menu also has settings to heal/digest your prey, as well as automatically activating the tech when you warp to a different world, and the button to deactivate it when you want to return to your normal self.
