"^cyan;So you've been turned into a Vaporeon...^reset;

First off, if you want to turn back, there is a menu accessible by pressing ^green;[E]^reset; to interact with your new self. In the bottom right corner of this menu, the ^yellow;[Despawn]^reset; button will turn you back to your normal self. This menu also allows you to select from various belly effects applied to your food, Player, NPC, and Monster alike.

The ^yellow;[Transform]^reset; button will transform the selected prey into a vaporeon as well! though this will not grant them the ability to change back and forth at will. If a specific prey isn't selected then all prey will be transformed.",
//2
"Digesting will restore your hunger, and if that is full, it'll restore your health as well.

Vappy has space for ^cyan;two prey^reset; in their belly, and can be positioned in ^cyan;several different states^reset;, each explained on its own page:^cyan;

Stand -> pg.3-4
Smol -> pg.6-7
Sit -> pg.8
Lay -> pg.9-10
Sleep -> pg.11
Back -> pg.12^reset;",
//3
"^cyan;Stand State^reset;

In this state you can walk and jump around as you would expect! ^green;Holding down^reset; allows you to walk at a slower pace. If you get ^cyan;too full^reset; you are also forced to walk, and your jump height is nerfed, ^darkgray;fatty~^reset;

If you just ^green;tap down^reset;, you can ^cyan;sit down (see pg.8)^reset;.

^green;Primary fire^reset; lets you bap with your foreleg.
^cyan;->^reset;",
//4
"If you are hovering your cursor over an edible creature when you do so, you can ^cyan;eat them^reset;! Otherwise it does some damage to enemies that it hits.
^green;Alt fire^reset; allows you to shoot a stream of water, however this consumes energy.

But sometimes being this big is inconvenient, huh? Luckily, pressing ^green;[F]^reset; allows one to become ^cyan;smol (see pg.6)^reset;.


^cyan;->^reset;",
//5
"If you want to let prey out, you must be in this state. Either open the menu and press ^yellow;[Let Out]^reset;, or press ^green;Tech Action 2^reset; (same story here, recommended key is ^green;[G]^reset;).",
//6
"^cyan;Smol State^reset;

The smol state has two versions!
If you have 0 or 1 occupants, you'll be a generally normal fishcat able to jump and walk around bapping and spraying water same as the ^cyan;Stand State^reset;, but unable to eat more prey.

However if you had 2 occupants, you'll become a ^cyan;chonk ball with a belly too big to walk with^reset;, and will have to ^green;roll around to move.^reset;

^cyan;->^reset;",
//7
"Being smol has its consequences though, as while you are smol, if you don't have any occupants in your belly, you can be ^cyan;eaten by other PVSOs^reset;!

Pressing ^green;[F]^reset; will return you to your ^cyan;normal size (see pg.3)^reset;",
//8
"^cyan;Sit State^reset;

In the sit state, you can tap ^green;down^reset; again to ^cyan;lay down (see pg.9)^reset;. If your belly is empty, and someone is standing in the right place just in front of you, you'll ^cyan;pin them underneath you^reset;.

You can also tap ^green;up^reset; to ^cyan;stand back up (see pg.3)^reset;.",
//9
"^cyan;Lay State^reset;

if you have pinned someone under you, you can ^cyan;lick^reset; them with ^green;primary fire^reset;, and then ^cyan;absorb them into your belly^reset; by pressing ^green;space^reset;!

You can tap ^green;down^reset; again to ^cyan;fall asleep (see pg.11)^reset;.

Or you can tap ^green;up^reset; to ^cyan;sit back up (see pg.8)^reset;, freeing anyone pinned under you.

^cyan;->^reset;",
//10
"As long as you have less than 2 occupants, you can also press ^green;either left or right^reset; to ^cyan;roll over (see pg.12)^reset;. If you do have 2 occupants, you'd be too fat to do so if you tried.",
//11
"^cyan;Sleep State^reset;

Pretty much all you can do here is ^cyan;wake up (see pg.9)^reset; by pressing ^green;up^reset;.",
//12
"^cyan;Back State^reset;

While laying on your back, as long as you have an empty belly people can ^cyan;lay on top of you like a bed^reset;!
If they do so you can press ^green;down^reset; to hug them, keeping them from getting off when they struggle, and while you're hugging someone you can press ^green;space^reset; to ^cyan;absorb them^reset; as well!

You can press to ^green;either side^reset; to ^cyan;roll back over (see pg.9)^reset;, taking anyone on your belly and ^cyan;pinning them beneath you^reset;."
