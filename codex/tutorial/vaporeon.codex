"^cyan;So you've been turned into a Vaporeon...^reset;

First off, if you want to turn back, there is a menu accessible via the ^green;Tech Action 3^reset; keybind. This must be bound manually in the settings menu, recommended keybind is ^green;[H]^reset;. In the bottom right corner of this menu, the ^yellow;[Despawn]^reset; button will turn you back to your normal self. This menu also allows you to select from various belly effects applied to your food, Player, NPC, and Monster alike. Digesting will restore your hunger, and if that is full, it'll restore your health as well.

Vappy has space for ^cyan;two prey^reset; in their belly.

Vappy can be positioned in ^cyan;several different states^reset;, each explained on its own page:

Stand -> pg.2
Smol -> pg.3
Sit -> pg.4
Lay -> pg.5
Sleep -> pg.6
Back -> pg.7 ",

"^cyan;Stand State^reset;

In this state you can walk and jump around as you would expect! ^green;Holding down^reset; allows you to walk at a slower pace. If you get ^cyan;too full^reset; you are also forced to walk, and your jump height is nerfed, ^darkgray;fatty~^reset;

If you just ^green;tap down^reset;, you can ^cyan;sit down (see pg.4)^reset;.

^green;Primary fire^reset; lets you bap with your foreleg. If you are hovering your cursor over an edible creature when you do so, you can ^cyan;eat them^reset;! Otherwise it does some damage to enemies that it hits.
^green;Alt fire^reset; allows you to shoot a stream of water, however this consumes energy.

But sometimes being this big is inconvenient, huh? Luckily, pressing ^green;[F]^reset; allows one to become ^cyan;smol (see pg.3)^reset;.

If you want to let prey out, you must be in this state. Either open the menu and press ^yellow;[Let Out]^reset;, or press ^green;Tech Action 2^reset; (same story here, recommended key is ^green;[G]^reset;).",

"^cyan;Smol State^reset;

The smol state has two versions!
If you have 0 or 1 occupants, you'll be a generally normal fishcat able to jump and walk around bapping and spraying water same as the ^cyan;Stand State^reset;, but unable to eat more prey.

However if you had 2 occupants, you'll become a ^cyan;chonk ball with a belly too big to walk with^reset;, and will have to ^green;roll around to move.^reset;

Being smol has its consequences though, as while you are smol, if you don't have any occupants in your belly, you can be ^cyan;eaten by other PVSOs^reset;!

Pressing ^green;[F]^reset; will return you to your ^cyan;normal size (see pg.2)^reset;",

"^cyan;Sit State^reset;

In the sit state, you can tap ^green;down^reset; again to ^cyan;lay down (see pg.5)^reset;. If your belly is empty, and someone is standing in the right place just in front of you, you'll ^cyan;pin them underneath you^reset;.

You can also tap ^green;up^reset; to ^cyan;stand back up (see pg.2)^reset;.",

"^cyan;Lay State^reset;

if you have pinned someone under you, you can ^cyan;lick^reset; them with ^green;primary fire^reset;, and then ^cyan;absorb them into your belly^reset; by pressing ^green;space^reset;!

You can tap ^green;down^reset; again to ^cyan;fall asleep (see pg.6)^reset;.

Or you can tap ^green;up^reset; to ^cyan;sit back up (see pg.4)^reset;, freeing anyone pinned under you.

As long as you have less than 2 occupants, you can also press ^green;either left or right^reset; to ^cyan;roll over (see pg.7)^reset;. If you do have 2 occupants, you'd be too fat to do so if you tried.",

"^cyan;Sleep State^reset;

Pretty much all you can do here is ^cyan;wake up (see pg.5)^reset; by pressing ^green;up^reset;.",

"^cyan;Back State^reset;

While laying on your back, as long as you have an empty belly people can ^cyan;lay on top of you like a bed^reset;!
If they do so you can press ^green;down^reset; to hug them, keeping them from getting off when they struggle, and while you're hugging someone you can press ^green;space^reset; to ^cyan;absorb them^reset; as well!

You can press to ^green;either side^reset; to ^cyan;roll back over (see pg.5)^reset;, taking anyone on your belly and ^cyan;pinning them beneath you^reset;."
