"So you've been turned into a Kaiju...

Xeronious can be in several states each explained on its own page, but there is a menu accessible in all states, accessible via tech action 3 (H)

This menu allows you to select from various effects applied to your food, Player, NPC, and Monster alike, digesting will restore your hunger, and if that is full, restore your health as well

If you have selected soft digest, upon reaching 1HP occupants of your belly will be put into eggs, which can then be laid if you can release the occupant in your current state, after getting released, those in the eggs can struggle to escape them, or you could just eat the eggs again before they do that

Stand -> pg.2
Crouch -> pg.3
Fly -> pg.4
Sit -> pg.5",

"State Stand

In this state you can walk and jump around as you would expect!
Holding down allows vappy to walk at a slower pace, if you get too full, you are also forced to walk, and your jump height is nerfed and you become unable to fly, which happens at three prey total, fatty

Pressing space while in the air lets you fly pg.4

Primary fire lets you bap, if you are hovering your cursor over an edible creature when you do so, you can eat them! Your belly has enough space for three prey
(there is no animation for when *not* eating currently)
If the prey you clicked on happens to be near your tail, you can eat them with that as well! your tail only has space for one prey

prey in the belly can struggle back and forth between them as long as they're stuggling towards the respective space, and theres space inside it to get into!

you can tap down to sit down pg.5

If you apporach a space you are too tall to fit through, you can hold down and attempt to crawl into it, or have it automatically triggered via a menu option pg.3

If you want to let prey out, you can use the menu, or press tech action 2 (G), if you are holding down then it will release them anally if they were in the belly",

"State Crouch

This state lets one crawl around through small spaces, it can only be exited if there is enough space to stand up, and if down is no longer held pg.2

Prey can only be let out via the tail in this state",

"State Fly

In this state you can fly around freely! but the more prey in you, the more you're weighed down, if you're carrying three prey or more you'll drop like a rock and be unable to fly pg.2

If you hover over some prey and Primary Fire click on them, you may be able to grab them with your feet and shove them up your butt and into your belly!

If you want to let prey out, you can use the menu, or press tech action 2 (G), if you are holding down then it will release them anally if they were in the belly",

"State Sit

While sitting, people can interact with you to let you hug them!

You can tap up to stand back up pg.2

You cannot lay eggs or release people anally while sitting, but you can let them out of the tail, and orally"
